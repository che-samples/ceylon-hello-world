This is a Ceylon project sample for a simple "Hello World" 
command-line application that can be compiled and executed 
on the 3 supported backends: JVM, Javascript on NodeJS, and Dart.

The project can be compiled and run for any of those backends with the
standard `compile...` / `run...` commands provided by the Ceylon stack.

The `clean modules` allows cleaning the `modules` directory that 
contains the compiles modules for all the backends.
